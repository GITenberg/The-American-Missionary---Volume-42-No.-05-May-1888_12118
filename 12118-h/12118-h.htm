    <h4>American Missionary Association.</h4>
    <hr class="quarter" />
    <p>Six months of our fiscal year have come to a close. It may be of interest to our
    readers to know how our treasury compares with the same period of time last year.
    During this half-year, there has been an increase in <i>collections</i> of $6,250.73,
    a decrease in the amount paid in from <i>estates</i> and <i>legacies</i> of
    $2,880.05, making a balance in the total receipts, of $3,370.68 in advance of those
    of the preceding year for the corresponding period.</p>
    <p>This, however, does not mean that we are in advance of our expenditures. All life
    predicates growth. When there is no growth, the body has begun to die. Those who will
    read the able paper of Dr. Bradford in this magazine, will doubtless conclude with
    him, that the imperative demand is for increased life, and for multiplied efforts to
    save those to whom Providence has manifestly called us. The natural and necessary
    growth of life has been upon us. While we have cut and trimmed and pinched with an
    economy that the most careful might think an unwise policy, there has yet been
    growth. Success necessitates development. Good schools will enlarge. One church
    creates another. One foothold secured in a missionary region opens districts to many
    who swell the cry of need to the heart of Christian compassion "<i>come over and help
    us</i>," so that with all our pruning the work has grown beyond the slight increase
    of funds from our churches.</p>
    <p>We ought to push our work. Ignorant millions need the truth which we have. They
    need the knowledge which we have. They need salvation, and if we have it and have the
    spirit of Christ's compassion, we will see that they are not left in darkness. There
    is enough and to spare in the hands of the disciples of Christ for this vast and
    increasingly urgent work. "Why," says George W. Cable, "if you knew the national
    value of this work, to say nothing of its gospel value, you would quadruplicate it
    before the year is out," He calls it "the most prolific missionary field that was
    ever opened to any Christian people," "right here at your doors."</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span>
    <p>While then we have the right to thank God and his people, and reason to take
    courage, we should be false to the churches and to ourselves should we fail to
    accentuate the necessities of our work, and the demand upon those in whose name we
    stand. Brethren, is not ours the appeal of Christ to you for his neglected and his
    needy ones? Bring your thank offerings to God and make enlargement for this enlarging
    work.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a>
    <p>We are thankful for our receipts from legacies. They are testimonies that speak,
    from those whose lips are sealed in death, for the gospel of Christ and its elevating
    and saving power when it is applied to the low-down and the poor and the wronged. In
    these legacies, those who are dead yet speak the word of life to those whom they have
    remembered.</p>
    <p>Our work, however, should be planned, not upon the uncertainties of legacies, but
    upon the ability and faith of those who live and give. It cheers us to know that our
    living donors are increasing and are entering with us the doors of opportunity which
    God has so manifestly opened and which no man can shut.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>We congratulate the American Home Missionary Society that it closes its year, not
    having realized its fears even if it has not absolutely compassed all its hopes. We
    are grateful, for its success. Our congratulations also are hearty that our great
    Foreign Missionary Society, the A.B.C.F.M., reports itself at the end of its fiscal
    half-year $78,000 in advance of what was received for the same period last year.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>But do not forget the great work which the churches have put upon us. See nearly
    eight millions who went from barbarism into slavery, and from slavery came out the
    poorest of the poor, the most ignorant of the ignorant, the most dependent of the
    dependent, without true religion and with no opportunity to know what true religion
    is unless we tell them. Africa is in America, China is in America, the barbarous
    heathen Indian is in America, and two millions of white people in the mountain region
    in four hundred counties, where ignorance is solid, are in America. These all look to
    the American Missionary Association. Will it not be our turn next to receive from the
    churches their increasing Godspeed on this work in such measure that we may carry the
    truth and the life to those who ought to have it.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The Connecticut Normal Industrial School previous to the brief spring vacation was
    visited by many northern friends at Thomasville, Ga., upon the occasion of its
    closing exercises. The <i>Thomasville Times</i> calls sympathetic <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>{119}</span> attention to the work
    and adds "That the boys and girls are being carefully taught and trained will be
    apparent to any one who will go to the Institution and see its workings. The
    attendance has averaged over two hundred." Thomasville is not far removed from
    Quitman geographically but, in point of intelligent regard for its own interests and
    the interests of the Negro, the distance is incalculable. As Joseph said to his
    brethren, we can say to the school incendiaries of Quitman, "Ye meant it for evil but
    the Lord meant it for good."</p>
    <hr />
    <p>An attractive and interesting four-paged weekly journal called the <i>Chinese
    Evangelist</i> comes to us. It is the first number of a curiosity in the way of a
    newspaper, being printed half in the English and half in the Chinese language. Its
    editor is Mr. J.S. Harper, son of Rev. A.F. Harper, of Canton College, and the
    manager is Guy Maine, a Christian Chinaman and member of the Broadway Tabernacle
    Church. The address of the editor is No. 117 West 87th St., New York, and of the
    manager, No. 15 University Place. It is intended for all workers in Chinese
    Sunday-schools, and every teacher of Chinese Sunday-school scholars would do well to
    send a dollar and secure this invaluable aid for a year. Its column of items is named
    "Tea Leaves." We would suggest that the motto for this bright little paper be "<i>Tu
    doces</i>."</p>

    <h3>THE VERNACULAR IN INDIAN SCHOOLS.</h3>
    <p>BY SECRETARY STRIKEY.</p>
    <p>This question is not settled. One thing that has kept it unsettled has been the
    uncertain use of the term "missionary schools" in the Orders of the Indian
    Department. What is precisely a missionary school? Let me try to explain. There are
    three kinds of schools in the nomenclature of the Indian Office, based on the sources
    of their support.</p>
    <p>1. <i>Government</i> Schools, supported wholly by Government
    appropriations&mdash;such as those at Carlisle, Genoa, etc. These may be left out of
    the account in this discussion, for no one objects to the Government's directing the
    studies in them.</p>
    <p>2. <i>Contract</i> Schools, so called because the missionary societies which
    sustain them receive under <i>contract</i> with the Government a certain amount of
    money in aid of their support. The school at Santee, Nebraska, and the school at
    Yankton, Dakota, are specimens of this class. But these are <i>mission</i> schools,
    for the societies which support them would not continue to do so for a day except for
    their missionary character; and yet these schools are classed by the Department not
    as missionary but as contract schools.</p>
    <p>3. <i>Missionary</i> Schools, which are supported wholly by missionary funds, the
    Government contributing nothing. Here, again, in the recent <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page120" id="page120"></a>{120}</span> order, the Department employs the
    confusing use of terms, speaking in general terms of "missionary schools," and then
    of missionary schools under the charge of "native Indian teachers," and at remote
    points; the inference being that the white teacher of a missionary school, though it
    may be in a place so remote that neither the pupils nor the people can understand the
    English language, cannot teach in the vernacular.</p>
    <p>With these explanations we present, under date of Feb. 11, 1888,</p>
    <h4>THE LATEST ORDERS OF THE DEPARTMENT.</h4>
    <p>1. No text-books in the vernacular will be allowed in any school where children
    are placed under contract or where the Government contributes, in any manner
    whatever, to the support of the school; no oral instruction in the vernacular will be
    allowed at such schools. The entire curriculum must be in the English language.</p>
    <p>2. The vernacular may be used in missionary schools only for oral instruction in
    morals and religion, where it is deemed to be an auxiliary to the English language in
    conveying such instruction; and only native Indian teachers will be permitted to
    otherwise teach in any Indian vernacular; and these native teachers will only be
    allowed so to teach in schools not supported in whole or in part by the Government
    and at remote points, where there are no Government or contract schools where the
    English language is taught. These native teachers are only allowed to teach in the
    vernacular with a view of reaching those Indians who cannot have the advantage of
    instruction in English, and such instruction must give way to the English-teaching
    schools as soon as they are established where the Indians can have access to
    them.</p>
    <p>3. A limited theological class of Indian young men may be trained in the
    vernacular at any purely missionary school, supported exclusively by missionary
    societies, the object being to prepare them for the ministry, whose subsequent work
    shall be confined to preaching unless they are employed as teachers in remote
    settlements, where English schools are inaccessible.</p>
    <p>4. These rules are not intended to prevent the possession or use by any Indian of
    the Bible published in the vernacular, but such possession or use shall not interfere
    with the teaching of the English language to the extent and in the manner
    hereinbefore directed.</p>
    <p>The gravamen of the objections urged in all this controversy is that the
    <i>Government has no right to interfere with these mission schools</i>; in the first
    place, in excluding all use of the vernacular in contract schools, even for religious
    instruction, and in the next place, in controlling the studies of the mission schools
    <i>supported wholly by missionary money</i> and in excluding white teachers from
    vernacular schools. The missionary societies have found by long experience that these
    mission schools in which the vernacular is taught, especially in remote places, are
    the most effective, and in many cases the only modes by which the people can be
    reached by the Gospel. The pupils are taught to read the Bible and it is carried by
    them to their homes. Now we ask, is it the function of the Government of the United
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>{121}</span> States to
    dictate in matters so purely religious and to override the Christian churches in the
    choice of their most approved methods of disseminating the Gospel?</p>
    <h4>PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S LETTER.</h4>
    <p>The President, under date of March 29, 1888, in response to some resolutions
    adopted by the Philadelphia M.E. Conference, writes a letter on this subject, which
    deserves careful and candid consideration, both for what it concedes and for what it
    does not concede. We present the portion of the letter bearing upon the points at
    issue.</p>
    <p>"Secular teaching is the object of the ordinary Government schools, but surely
    there can be no objection to reading a chapter in the Bible in English, or in Dakota
    if English could not be understood, at the daily opening of those schools, as is done
    in very many other well-regulated secular schools. It may be, too, that the use of
    words in the vernacular may be sometimes necessary to aid in communicating a
    knowledge of the English language, but the use of the vernacular should not be
    encouraged or continued beyond the limit of such necessity, and the "text books," the
    "oral instruction" in a general sense, and the curriculum certainly should be in
    English. In missionary schools moral and religious instruction may be given in the
    vernacular as an auxiliary to English in conveying such instruction. Here, while the
    desirability of some instruction in morals and religion is recognized, the extreme
    value of learning the English language is not lost sight of. And the provision which
    follows, that only native teachers shall "otherwise" (that is, except for moral or
    religious instruction) teach the vernacular, and only in remote places and until
    Government or contract schools are established, is in exact keeping with the purpose
    of the Government to exclude the Indian languages from the schools as far as is
    consistent with a due regard for the continuance of moral and religious teaching in
    the missionary schools, and except in such cases as the exclusion would result in the
    entire neglect of secular or other instruction."</p>
    <p>On this letter let me remark:</p>
    <p>1. That it concedes what has not heretofore been granted, the reading of the Bible
    in the vernacular in contract schools and its use in explaining the English. We
    accept this concession with gratification.</p>
    <p>2. But it makes no concession whatever (beyond that made in the order of the
    Commissioner) in regard to the use of the vernacular in schools supported wholly by
    missionary funds, or in the employment of white teachers in vernacular schools in
    remote districts. Until concessions are made on these points, the controversy will go
    forward.</p>
    <p>The aim of the Government is <i>expedient</i>, in trying to secure ultimately the
    use of the English language among the Indians. The aim of the missionary societies is
    to fulfil an imperative <i>duty</i>, in trying to reach the Indians with the Gospel
    in the most effective methods. There should be mutual respect for these aims; the
    Government should yield to the conscientious conviction of the missionary societies
    as to methods for giving religious <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
    id="page122"></a>{122}</span> instruction, and the missionary societies should
    co-operate with the Government in introducing the English language as rapidly as
    possible consistently with their higher aim. I venture to suggest an outline of
    Regulations that would probably attain both these objects and meet other objections
    to the ruling of the Department that are not removed by the President's letter.</p>
    <h4>DETAILS OF PROPOSED REGULATIONS.</h4>
    <p>1. No text-books in the vernacular will be allowed in any Government school,
    supported wholly by the Government; no oral instruction in the vernacular will be
    allowed at such schools. The entire curriculum must be in the English language.</p>
    <p>2. In contract schools supported in part by missionary societies, the vernacular
    may be used only for the reading of the Sacred Scriptures, and for oral instruction
    in morals and religion and where it is deemed to be an auxiliary to the English
    language in conveying such instruction.</p>
    <p>3. In all "missionary schools" supported entirely by missionary or benevolent
    funds, no restrictions will be put upon the use of the vernacular, with the
    understanding, however, that the English language shall be introduced as rapidly as
    those conducting these schools shall deem compatible with the higher
    aim&mdash;religious teaching; and that when these schools shall be prepared to use
    the English language wholly, the Department will give them a place on the list of
    contract schools rather than to establish others in their stead. If new mission
    schools are established they must be so located as not to interfere with existing
    Government or contract schools.</p>
    <p>4. That any religious denomination shall, at its discretion and entirely at its
    own cost, be allowed to conduct special classes in the vernacular for the training of
    teachers and preachers. As it is desirable that those teachers and preachers should
    be taught in English studies as well as in the vernacular, these classes may be
    conducted in connection with contract schools, yet so as not to interfere in any way
    with the regular curriculum in the English language.</p>

    <p>"Ramona Days," is the title of a neatly printed pamphlet of forty-three pages,
    being the January number of a quarterly, published by the Indian Department of the
    University of New Mexico. This Indian school is named in honor of Mrs. Helen Hunt
    Jackson, who has rendered such valuable services to the Indians in setting forth in
    thrilling terms their wrongs, and in pleading so pathetically for their rights. The
    Ramona school is under the efficient supervision of Pres. H.O. Ladd, and is aided in
    part by the American Missionary Association.</p>
    <p>The pamphlet is not a catalogue of the school, but contains a variety of
    interesting matter on Indian affairs, the titles of some of the articles being;
    "Wiser Methods," "Famous Apache Chiefs," "Treaty Obligations to the Navajoes," "A
    Recent Movement Toward Indian Civilization," "Ramona Memorial," etc., etc. There are

    <h3>THE TIME FACTOR IN THE SOUTHERN PROBLEM.</h3>
    <p>BY REV. A.H. BRADFORD, D.D.</p>
    <p>The supreme question in English politics is the unity of the empire. The problem
    of the mother country is, How may the scattered colonies be joined in one body whose
    heart shall be London? All the other questions of the island-empire are but parts of
    this. This in turn is forced into prominence by the under-current of the world's
    aspiration for larger liberty. "The world no longer for the few, but for the many,"
    is the watchword of an increasing number in all the nations. How to maintain the
    manhood of her subjects, and yet not to force the dismemberment of the empire, is the
    question uppermost in old England.</p>
    <p>With us, the problem is not one of scattered colonies but of divergent people.
    There is in the United States the double problem of how to consolidate and preserve
    the interests of a nation with a long area north and south, and with the most diverse
    elements of population ever gathered under one flag. This is complicated by other
    factors. Our study is confined to those which touch what is known as the Southern
    question. The problems of English and American political and religious life are
    identical in that both are inspired by the watchword of the rising multitudes, "The
    world for the many."</p>
    <p>The Southern problem is but part of the larger one of area and races. Consider a
    few facts. The South is peopled chiefly by two classes, native whites and native
    blacks. Both whites and blacks are there to remain. More whites leave the South than
    blacks, and the population is increasing. Emigration avoids the States chiefly
    inhabited by blacks. It is not probable that the exodus of whites will be very great.
    The population of the future will probably be of the same classes, although the
    proportion is rapidly changing. Native whites and native blacks, unless signs fail,
    will possess the land.</p>
    <p>The Negro race is appallingly fertile. It shows no sign of decadence. It is
    multiplying faster than any other. The number of blacks in the United States has
    risen from four millions to nearly eight millions since the war. That has been
    entirely by natural reproduction. The increase of whites during the decade from 1870
    to 1880 was twenty-nine per cent.; of blacks thirty-five per cent. If, now, we allow
    nine per cent. for the increase of the whites by immigration, we find that the
    increase of blacks over the whites by natural order is about fourteen per cent. Here,
    then, is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>{124}</span>
    simple problem in arithmetic. If the blacks increase on an average fourteen per cent.
    faster than the whites, and to the South there is little immigration, how long will
    it be before the blacks preponderate? They will go neither to Africa, to Mexico, nor
    to the West Indies. They are here to stay. They are multiplying faster than their
    white neighbors. They are growing in consciousness of power faster than in
    intelligence. What is the sure result of conscious but blind power? The story of
    Samson answers. The problem is the new-birth of a rapidly increasing race. How long
    it will take may possibly be imagined from the questions which follow.</p>
    <p>I. How long will it require for race-prejudices to go? I put that question to an
    intelligent colored man who had been a slave. His answer was, "Until the present
    generation is dead."</p>
    <p>The conflict between classes in the South will last until they recognize that they
    have an identity of interests, or that they are brethren. Prejudice is neither dead
    nor fast dying. There is a change in the cities, but it does not reach far inland. In
    how many Southern States are the same privileges extended to both races in schools?
    in cars? in hotels? in churches? This prejudice is in the blood. Heredity and
    training have both fostered it. Race prejudices die slowly. For centuries the contest
    between Patrician and Plebeian was carried on in ancient Rome. The subject-class
    never affiliated with the master-class. Two or three hundred years ago a new people
    was introduced into the north of Ireland. The north is essentially Scottish. Its
    inhabitants are Protestant and phlegmatic. In the south, the religion is Romanist,
    and the people are mercurial. They are of the same color. They have had the same
    history for centuries. For nearly five hundred years, the Turk has been a disturbing
    factor in Europe. The Turk is Asiatic. He is surrounded by European life. How rapidly
    has the antipathy between races disappeared where the Turk has power? The race-lines
    are as distinct as if the waters of a white river and a black ran in the same
    channel. The Hebrews are found in all parts of the world. They are industrious, and
    as decent as the average man; they mingle with other people, and yet almost
    everywhere the prejudice against them is constant and bitter. How long before
    Protestant Orangemen and Catholic Irishmen will walk arm and arm in the same
    procession? How long before the German and Russian and Englishman will recognize the
    Jew as a brother? In the South, the antipathy is between black and white, between a
    master-class and a subject-class, between oppressed and oppressor. How long before
    this prejudice will disappear?</p>
    <p>II. How much time will be required for the consciousness of having been wronged to
    wear from the breast and the blood of the black man? This consciousness of having
    been wronged is not a race-prejudice, and yet it may become one. It is hard to
    eradicate. It is aggravated when the same feelings are in many hearts. This is a
    complicated factor. Some of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
    id="page125"></a>{125}</span> the blacks seem incapable of sentiments of revenge.
    They are too lighthearted to cherish grievances. But all are not so. The pure blacks
    who carry with them the consciousness of having been deeply injured, are many. What
    will you say of the mulattoes? A man who knows his father, and knows that his father
    ignores his existence, may keep it to himself, but he cannot smother his feeling. He
    who sees his brothers and sisters pass him on the street in carriages, living in
    comfort and honor, while he is poor, and nothing to them, will, in proportion as he
    is a man, hate the social order in which they live. Until this consciousness of
    having been injured and degraded vanishes, the Southern question will disturb
    political and social life.</p>
    <p>III. Closely allied to the consciousness of degradation is the lack of manly
    feeling. Appreciation of manhood is a condition of improvement. He who thinks himself
    only an animal will live like one. Does this condition exist at the South? It could
    not be otherwise. Any one who has travelled there must have his faith in the
    evolution of some men from the lower animals immeasurably strengthened. Rev. Dr.
    Taylor, of New York, has said that he knows that the Darwinian theory cannot be true,
    because, if it were, "an Englishman's right arm would have developed into an umbrella
    long ago." But Dr. Taylor would find faces in the South which, from their resemblance
    to lower orders of life, might weaken his faith in his demonstration.</p>
    <p>The black race is no more degraded than our own would be under similar
    circumstances, but its condition is appalling. How long will it take to develop the
    consciousness of manhood where all the tastes, and all the tendencies, and almost all
    the environment, are low and in the opposite direction? The colored people have not
    the help of higher and refining influences. Their tendencies have been downward, and
    present environment increases the tendency. Regeneration or reform is not the work of
    a year or a generation. The change will come only by the creation of new and higher
    conditions, and with the birth of a more self-respecting stock.</p>
    <p>IV. How long will be required for the education of the colored people and the poor
    whites?</p>
    <p>The author of "An Appeal to Caesar" says, "The Southern man, black or white, is
    not likely to be greatly different to-morrow from what he was yesterday. Generations
    may modify; years can only restrain. The question is not whether education, begun
    to-day and carried on however vigorously and successfully by the most approved
    agencies, would change the characteristics of to-day's masses. Not at all. The
    question is whether it would so act upon them <i>as they are</i>, would so enlighten
    and inform their minds, as to convince them of the mutual danger, peril, disaster,
    that must attend continual oppression or sudden uprising. We cannot expect to make
    intelligence instantly effective in the elevation of individual citizenship, or the
    exercise of collective power. Little by little that change must come."</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>{126}</span>
    <p>About ninety per cent, of the whole colored population of the South, and about
    forty-five per cent. of those above ten years of age, are illiterate. In 1880,
    nineteen per cent., or about one in every five, of the white people of the South, and
    seventy-three per cent. of the colored people, could neither read nor write; and this
    estimate is far too large. After fifteen years of the ballot, seventy-three per cent.
    of the colored race of the South could neither read nor write. Much is being done to
    promote education by schools and charities, but what are these among so many? To meet
    the ignorant condition of things, the Government is doing nothing. The State
    governments are doing only a little. In the Southern States previous to the war there
    was no system of common schools. After the war there were not even old foundations to
    build upon. Everything had to be started <i>de novo</i> by those who had nothing with
    which to start. "We must remember," said Dr. Mayo, "that nine men out of ten of the
    South never saw what we call a good public elementary school. It has been said that
    the public school-buildings of Denver alone exceed in value all the public
    school-buildings of the State of North Carolina."</p>
    <p>The average school year throughout the South, in 1880, was less than one hundred
    days; the average attendance less than thirty per cent. of those within school age.
    In a belt of States where seventy-three per cent., and probably ninety per cent., of
    the population are illiterate, where they are too poor to do much except keep up the
    struggle for existence, where there are no traditions of culture, where it has been a
    crime for a black man to read, where the Nation is doing nothing, and where the
    State, when it does its best, provides instruction which reaches only thirty per
    cent. of those of school age for one hundred days in a year, and where the population
    is increasing so rapidly that in 1900 the blacks will be in a decided majority,
    charity and religion are doing&mdash;what? The progress under the circumstances is
    amazing, but how long will it take to educate the nineteen per cent. of Southern
    whites, and seventy-three per cent., of Southern blacks? There is more illiteracy now
    than at the close of the war, because education has not kept pace with the increase
    of the race.</p>
    <p>V. How long will be required for the <i>moralizing</i> of the lower classes of the
    South? Ability to make moral discriminations grows slowly. Ability to appreciate
    moral motives grows still more slowly. These people were trained in a school in which
    virtue was ignored. They have lived under conditions which have put a premium on
    theft. Slavery always makes thieves. The heredity of the passion for stealing is just
    as clearly marked as the heredity of the Roman nose or the faculty for music. The
    transmission of the tendency toward the gratification of the animal propensities is
    as definite as, and stronger than, the tendency for insanity and consumption to
    reproduce themselves. These people come into life blind, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> and find little but darkness around
    them. Here you have about eight millions with an ancestry which began in heathenism
    and has had two centuries of slavery&mdash;a people inheriting all the evils of
    slavery; a people who have never been trained to make moral discriminations, and
    whose ancestors for unknown generations have been trained still less than they; a
    people who have none, or at least but little, of the inspiration toward a higher
    moral life which comes from a healthy environment; a people whose religion is almost
    all emotional; who can soar on the wings of imagination and enthusiasm to heights
    which would make an archangel dizzy; who from paroxysms of anguish at the condition
    of those whose burning bodies are lighting the fires of hell, will go off and commit
    adultery or rob a hen-roost as complacently as if to do so were a part of their
    religion. This is not fiction. Religion has not meant chastity, for slavery made that
    impossible; it has not meant justice, for injustice forged their chains; it has not
    meant generosity, for they had nothing; it has been simple emotion. The ethical
    element has been absent, and it was through no fault of the black man.</p>
    <p>In 1860, President Hopkins said that a greater proportion of the Sandwich
    Islanders could read than of the people in New England. They were educated but not
    moralized. There were three hundred thousand of them a century and a half ago; in
    1883, there were forty-nine thousand. Education without morality is no safeguard.</p>
    <p>Prof. Gilliam shows, from census reports, that if the population of the Southern
    whites increases for a century, as at present, in 1985, there will be ninety-six
    million whites in the Southern States, and in 1980, one hundred and ninety-two
    million blacks. Statistics may lie; but there is enough truth in these to give
    terrible emphasis to the inquiry, How long before the colored people will be
    sufficiently educated to need no help? How long before they will have sufficient
    moral discrimination to know what the commandments require? When we realize how
    difficult is the task of inducing men with the environment of Christian influence at
    the North, and in England, to live even decent lives, the wonder is that the freedmen
    do as well as they do. How long before we can expect a race with such antecedents and
    environments to be fitted to be left to themselves? What answer must be given? I am
    not exaggerating the picture. I am only hinting at conditions of heathenism which
    exist. I am least of all blaming these poor and needy people; but none the less clear
    and strong comes the appeal for their moral and intellectual emancipation. The
    moralizing of a race which has such a history, how long will that require? No people
    ever rose more rapidly in the world's history. That shows what is possible. It does
    not tell us when our work will be finished. So long as one-half of the American
    republic is inhabited by those whose interests are alien to the other half, there can
    be no permanent prosperity. It has been said that there are three essentials to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>{128}</span> permanent unity
    of a nation; viz., unity of language, unity of interest and unity of religion. There
    is a common language between the blacks and whites, but the unity of interest is not
    recognized, and agreement in religion is only in name. The religion of the poor
    whites in the South is mechanical, and unintelligently doctrinal; the religion of the
    blacks is emotional and fantastic; and the religion of both blacks and whites is
    lacking in the ethical element. The process of political reconstruction has been
    progressing for twenty years and more, and is still incomplete. That is an easy work
    compared with what must be created intellectually, and socially, and morally. Before
    the Southern problem will be solved, a new stock must take the place of those who
    were reared in slavery; the old traditions must fade, and education, and an ethical
    type of Christianity, must do their work. How long will be required for that, none
    can tell. In the meantime, new complications may arise. The principles of socialism
    and anarchy are not unlikely to pervade the South, and if the masses of blacks are
    ever exploited by a central, unknown and irresponsible committee of agitators, the
    results must be a new reign of terror. The labor agitators are moving southward. It
    has been said that colored people have no tendencies toward socialism and anarchy. I
    am no prophet, but I will hazard the prediction that it will not be long before the
    socialistic agitator will stir up a commotion at the South that will make employers
    of labor and people of wealth tremble.</p>
    <p>The sentiment has sometimes been whispered, that the work of this Association, and
    those akin to it, was about accomplished. That sentiment has selfishness or ignorance
    at the bottom of it. How long must this work be kept up? Until all that mass of
    darkness which fills the Southern horizon be shot through and through with shafts of
    light. How long must it be kept up? Until the last trace of prejudice that separates
    brother from brother shall have been removed. How long will this thing be kept up?
    Until the black man feels that he is a man; until he can vote intelligently, and live
    wisely, and until he has the ability and the will to discriminate carefully in
    matters of morals. How long must it be kept up? Until no man can plead ignorance, or
    want of opportunity, for rejecting the Lord Jesus Christ. The Eastern question has
    been a live question in European politics for more than four centuries. It is no more
    puzzling than the Southern question is with us. There is an experiment in physics
    that is typical of this work. An iron bar is suspended in the air and then a tiny
    cork, hung from a string, is thrown against it. At first no impression is made, but
    the blows are repeated, until, by and by, the bar begins to tremble, then to vibrate,
    then to swing to and fro. The repeated impacts of the little cork at last move the
    mass. It will not be by any great rush that the Southern problem will be solved. It
    will yield at last to the constancy, and fidelity, of the great multitude of those
    who love their brother because they love their Lord; who are content to work in
    secret, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>{129}</span> and
    many of whom already rest in unmarked graves. That mass of ignorance, wretchedness
    and wrong will swing and disappear at last before the multitudinous strokes of
    individual gifts and individual prayers.</p>
    <p>All the problems which are vexing the older nations are essentially social
    problems, and the watchword of all the movements that are undermining thrones and
    caste, and the wicked social order, is, "The world no longer for the few, but for the
    many." In America the <i>many</i> are already in possession, and the problem with us
    is, How may our rulers&mdash;the people who can never be dethroned&mdash;be rendered
    competent to rule? That is the question to which the American Missionary Association
    is devoting itself; and its answer is the only true one: By making the people
    intelligent, and Christian. And how long before that will be accomplished? A
    Scotchman once asked an Irishman, "Why were half-farthings coined in England?" Pat
    instantly replied, "To give Scotchmen an opportunity of contributing to missions."
    When will this problem be solved? Never, if the Christians of America are like Pat's
    Scotchman, but quicker than any of us dream, if all the Christians of America are
    like that woman in the New Testament who put into the treasury two mites.</p>

    <h2>THE SOUTH.</h2>
    <h3>SOUTHERN TESTIMONY.</h3>
    <p>We insert the following from the <i>Southern Presbyterian</i>, as a recent
    testimony to the views, principles and work of the American Missionary Association.
    It will be all the stronger from the fact that it was not written for a testimony,
    but as a setting forth of facts by a Southerner to Southerners.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The old masters and the old slaves are now rapidly passing into eternity. In ten
      years more no one of our people, white or black, under <i>forty years</i> of age,
      will know personally anything of slavery. It then comes to this, that now and from
      this time forward, we white Christians must be impressed with the fact that we have
      here at our doors, in our houses, offices, stores and kitchens, and on our farms,
      not slaves, but a race of people, three-fourths of whom are but a little removed
      from savages in so far as their knowledge of religion is concerned. They have among
      them those whom they call preachers; they hold meetings, they halloo, they shout,
      but no <i>saving truth</i> is preached or heard from that source. The result is
      great animal excitement, but no moral elevation. Then many of them are receiving
      secular education. That sharpens their intellects but gives no Christian character.
      It does just the opposite; it fits them for rascality. They are increasing. There
      are probably eight millions of them now, and there will be many millions more.
      Those who are dying without Christ are dying here in a Christian land without
      hope.</p>
      <p>The statement of a Congregational missionary recently made, is probably true,
      viz.: that "one-fourth of the race is improving rapidly," yet much the larger part
      of them are almost, if not altogether, <i>heathen</i>. They are not across the
      ocean; under God's providence they are here, where you can touch them with your
      finger. Why here? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
      id="page130"></a>{130}</span> It will not do to say that nothing can be made out of
      them. Go to Texas, to Tennessee, and come right here to Atlanta now, and our most
      intelligent white men will tell you that on the prohibition question, negroes,
      educated, smart and very eloquent, have made, and are making, <i>ringing</i>
      speeches. There have been smart speakers on both sides. Some of their speeches
      would do credit to any white orator in the South. Dr. Sanderson, our late Professor
      at Tuskaloosa, stated on the floor of the Synod of Alabama last week, that he had
      taught a good deal, and that a young negro, twenty years of age, one of our
      divinity students at Tuskaloosa, was as smart a pupil as he had ever seen; that if
      he were in the State University he would be in its first rank of students, and that
      he heard him recently preach a sermon on the mediatorial work of Christ, such that
      he (Dr. Sanderson) would not undertake to make a better one on that majestic theme.

      <p>In Dallas Presbytery, Texas, recently, a black man was examined for two days on
      Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and on all that is required by our Book of Government for
      ordination, and he did not falter once. So the brethren there testify.</p>
      <p>Then it comes to this: this race of people is here; the great body of them are
      heathen. Can anyone doubt that it is the purpose of the Almighty to prepare a large
      number of them, converted, educated and civilized, to go back to Africa to redeem
      that continent for civilization and for Christ? We are commanded to preach the
      Gospel to every creature, to teach it to all nations.</p>

    <h3>OUR WORK, AS A GRADUATE OF FISK UNIVERSITY SEES IT.</h3>
    <p>BY WILLIAM A. CROSTHWAITE.</p>
    <p>The American Missionary Association is doing more to quicken the hopes and
    aspirations of the Southern Negro, more toward arousing the Southern white man to
    educate himself, and more toward bringing the two races to an acknowledgment of each
    other's rights, than any other similar institution in the country.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 1884, near Leesburg, Texas, a well-appointed Negro school was
    burned by the whites of that community. The colored people, seeing their hope of
    years in ashes, advertised their little holdings for sale, and prepared to leave in a
    body. But the whites offered to supplement the insurance on the former building and
    to re-build the school, if the colored people would remain in the community. The
    terms were accepted, and now <i>West Chapel</i>, which is the name of the school, is
    excellently furnished and has a $200 bell upon it, and is the best known school in
    Northeast Texas. Previous to the burning of West Chapel, the whites were continually
    distracted by factional fights. There was general apathy with regard to improvement
    in any way whatever. Their teachers were always of the inferior class. But, when they
    found that the colored people would have a school, they decided to have one also. The
    colored people bought a bell. So did they. The colored people had a foreign teacher.
    So must they have one, and they paid $750 a year for him. One of the white citizens
    of the locality summed the situation up thus:&mdash;"West Chapel is to the whites
    what a coal of fire is on the back of a terrapin." This school was organized by a
    Fisk student and has ever <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
    id="page131"></a>{131}</span> since been taught by students of Fisk. Thus is the
    A.M.A. lifting up the Negro directly and the whites indirectly, and establishing
    friendly relations between the two.</p>
    <p>But this is no isolated case. The story is the same wherever the educated Negro
    comes in contact with the whites. At one time, our school was so far in advance of
    the white school, that I was told by my school director that "no high-learnt teacher
    was wanted to teach 'Nigger Schools,'" and I was actually driven from my school by
    threats of violence.</p>
    <p>The North can better understand the work of the American Missionary Association,
    when it is fully understood that the presence of Fisk University in Nashville brought
    about the existence of Vanderbilt University. When Fisk began to send out her
    graduates as refined and upright gentlemen, and the newspapers were enthusiastic in
    their accounts of its literary and musical exhibitions, the white people said; "We
    must have a university in Nashville also."</p>
    <p>In the recent Prohibition campaign in Tennessee, the students of Fisk were one of
    the chief factors. In the beginning of the movement, the cry; "Where does Fisk stand
    on this question?" went up from the good people all over the State. Fisk was the
    first college to declare in favor of the proposed Amendment, and one hundred young
    men and women went from her walls and fought valiantly for the cause.</p>
    <p>It is due the profound Christian spirit that characterizes the work of the
    Association to say, that every student and alumnus of Fisk in the State of Tennessee
    was an ardent supporter of the cause, save two. During the campaign the most cordial
    feelings existed between the better elements of both races. Heretofore these things
    were almost unheard of.</p>
    <p>There was a time when policy or political expediency had no effect upon the
    prejudices of the Southern whites, but the educational process inaugurated by the
    North is elevating a class of colored people to a plane where they are respected as
    never before. No State or Federal aid can do for us what the A.M.A. is doing. Such
    aid as the Blair Bill proposed would meet a certain need, and enable the men that are
    educated by the A.M.A. to get at the masses; but the peculiar work of preparing
    honest and devout Christian leaders must be otherwise provided for. The complete
    regeneration of the South is a thing of the future. The A.M.A. must remain among us
    to hasten on "the harvest of the golden year."</p>
    <p>That the Christianization of the Negro must come from without his own
    institutions, will be clearly seen by looking at his present religious condition. The
    new life that is developing cannot be crowded into the narrow limits of his church.
    The moral element is almost entirely wanting in his creed and doctrine. Such is the
    condition of the church that moral and spiritual growth are impossible. He must be
    educated away from the institutions that attended his enslavement; as far from them
    as Canaan is from Egypt. Again, the pulpit, with comparatively few honorable
    exceptions, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>{132}</span> is
    filled with adventurers and impure ministers. To a great extent this is true. But
    signs of a spiritual and moral exodus are everywhere manifest. The judgment of God
    rests heavily upon the Negro's temple-worship and the structure tumbles to the
    ground. Within the last two years I have seen six of the largest colored churches in
    Tennessee split on moral grounds, and the discontent with what is bad, grows among
    them. The old associations are losing their power over the rising generation.
    Intelligent men are seeking to supply their spiritual and moral wants. The A.M.A. has
    but to persist in the establishment of its school and church work among the colored
    people, with good strong men as ministers, and it is sure to be the leaven of the
    church of the future for the Negro people.</p>
    <p>Last summer an old father, who had educated four children at Fisk University and
    had himself been there on one Commencement occasion, said to me:&mdash;"That Fisk
    school is the <i>buildin'-up-est</i> place to our people in the world. I never expect
    to have such a good time and treatment again until I get to heaven." Thus are our
    hopes quickened and our aspirations for nobler things awakened.</p>
    <p>But to one who understands the situation, the question of our education is of
    serious moment. All our institutions of higher learning are living from hand to
    mouth, with no endowment, and the North's purse-strings are growing tighter as the
    years go by. On the other hand, prejudice strikes savagely at our State
    appropriations. This year, in the advanced State of Tennessee, the white
    State-student gets one hundred dollars while the colored gets only twenty-two dollars
    and a half. In his poverty what can the Negro student do with this sum in the way of
    educating himself?</p>
    <p>I could take you in the homes of those whom you have educated, then could you
    appreciate the wisdom of your investments. It is around the fireside, and in the
    conduct of the children, that your noble work is manifesting itself so clearly. The
    intellectual, moral and spiritual life found there are the true and only guarantees
    that old things are passing away.</p>
    <p>The abject condition of the great body of Negroes appeals to Christian religion
    and philanthropy for the help that must come to redeem their lost minds and souls.
    The South cannot give them a Christian education. The cry goes up to the great, warm
    heart of the North. We crave the crumbs that fall from your God-given, bountiful
    table.</p>

    <h3>A PASTOR'S FIRST VIEW.</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A pastor who was educated at the North and who was graduated at the Hartford
      Theological Seminary, has for the first time made the acquaintance of his race in
      the South. He had never met his own people as a race until he entered into the
      service of the American Missionary Association. His impressions and testimony have,
      therefore, an additional interest.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In reference to the field: it is large and interesting, and requires more <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>{133}</span> than ordinary
    attention, both to that part of it under cultivation and that which is not yet. I
    have arranged my visits in such a way as to make it practicable for me to do justice
    to both; visiting church members the last week in each month (except in case of
    sickness), and using the rest of the time (apart from other necessary duties) for
    visits outside.</p>
    <p>I am thus brought into direct contact with our people and learn a great deal about
    their condition. In some places it does seem actually as if liberty and civilization
    are still mysteries to them.</p>
    <p>When I was in the North and heard or read descriptions of the condition and mode
    of living of the colored people of the South, I often thought that those descriptions
    were very highly colored, but I am now perfectly cured of all my doubts. My visits
    furnish me with the most plausible attestation of the facts. Squalor, with its long
    train of attendants, may be commonly seen in every direction, and perhaps not
    confined to the lower-conditioned of our people either. The desecration of the Lord's
    day is actually frightful. It is very literally used as a "day of rest from labor."
    On every hand the people are seen resting&mdash;resting from labor in the houses, on
    the stoops and on the streets, instead of being in the house of God. In very many
    instances, however, we succeed in getting some of them to attend church, but the work
    is somewhat uphill. I trust that this abnormal condition to which slavery has reduced
    them will eventually succumb to the effective educational weapon that is being
    brought to bear upon them, that of the American Missionary Association especially,
    and may the time soon come for the South when the Holy Spirit working in and through
    the various missionary Boards, and also other agencies, shall spread righteousness
    and education and the true art of living, among these benighted people. I am praying,
    others are praying, and you, too, must help us to pray and to wait for the quickening
    influences and a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h3>TALLADEGA FRUIT.</h3>
    <p>BY MISS E.B. EMERY.</p>
    <p>The missions of the American Missionary Association at the South are like orange
    trees, perennial, evergreen, and continually bearing golden fruit, and of these there
    is none more abounding in vitality than Talladega. All the year round the foliage
    glistens, the blossoming sheds its fragrance, and every winter there is an ample
    harvest. Sometimes one from abroad comes in to shake the tree and gather the fruit,
    and sometimes not; but however that may be, the soil is previously and thoroughly
    prepared by these consecrated missionaries, the tree is watered and nourished and
    tended the year round, and the harvest <i>expected</i>, and it comes.</p>
    <p>Are there no spiritual frosts to blight? They are impossible, if the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>{134}</span> spiritual atmosphere
    be kept clear, and the Holy Ghost be a daily and hourly companion and friend.</p>
    <p>It is by no means unusual in Talladega for every unbelieving pupil in the boarding
    department to be converted. This year there were over forty hopeful conversions, and
    Rev. James Wharton, an English evangelist, by his earnest preaching was of very great
    assistance. It is noticeable that if any who have had little <i>previous</i> training
    are converted through the preaching of an evangelist, they are not likely to hold out
    well.</p>
    <p>On the first Sunday in March, twenty-seven of the converts were received into the
    college church, with two from the Baptist Church. More will come later as the fruits
    of the revival, while a few will join other churches. Eighteen of the number were
    young men, and among them were the two sons of Pres. DeForest, one fourteen, the
    other nine, years of age.</p>
    <p>Prof. G.W. Andrews, D.D., the pastor this year, conducted the services; there was
    no sermon proper and no time for any, but there was much of the beautiful music of
    these colored people; they sing out their fervid souls with their rich and powerful
    voices. Nearly all were baptized, and much more was made of the right hand of
    fellowship than is usual in any Northern church. And it is needful for these
    children, for they will call for constant help months and years to come. With few
    exceptions, they are not reared in Christian homes, are not educated from the cradle
    in the Christian faith. The services were both solemn and joyful, and very tender and
    touching.</p>
    <p>Such an avowal is the most significant of all things, anytime, anywhere, but here
    we know that every life is to be one of toil and bitter struggle, a fight in which
    the odds are, to appearances, all against them; more than all, that this young man,
    that young woman, with the dusky face, the mellow voice and the eager spirit, now in
    covenant with us, is to be a missionary to the heathen, and of his own people. What
    may he not accomplish? What may she not do for Christ? And these heathen are in our
    own country; they are our own people. These young missionaries are very peculiarly
    ours, and it is through the Northern churches that they are trained for their work.
    Shall not then those churches adopt them in their hearts, carry them in their
    prayers, and let them suffer no lack in their preparation? Their work in the future
    for the Master's kingdom will depend very much upon us Christians of the North.</p>
    <p>Talladega College is exceedingly prosperous. The day-school is very large; the
    Sunday-school packs the chapel, and the Sunday congregation is much too crowded for
    health or comfort in a room seating but two hundred and fifty. The college is working
    all the time, for a church, earning many small sums. The result, with some gifts,
    amounts to about $400. Where is the man or the woman to aid in this godly enterprise?
    to share in this work so essential and so abundantly fruitful?</p>

    <h3>THREE PICTURES FROM LE MOYNE SCHOOL, MEMPHIS, TENN.</h3>
    <p>BY MISS ESTHER H. BARNES.</p>
    <p>I would like to bring before you three pictures which I saw this week. The first
    is the interior of a single room. The tattered, soiled bed and the fireplace took up
    a large part of the room, and the rest was nearly filled with the confusion of odds
    and ends that make up the belongings of such a home. A feeble fire rested on the
    uneven bricks of the fireplace, and the chimney above was covered with newspapers in
    the last stages of dilapidation and dirt. There was no window, but a little sliding
    shutter, moved aside a few inches, admitted light enough to make the darkness visible
    as it fell on the smoke-stained boards, and the dusky faces of the inmates seated
    close to the fire on old chairs and boxes. A home more forlorn than this little pen,
    which, with a smaller back shed, is the only residence of at least five human beings,
    I can hardly conceive.</p>
    <p>Now for a more cheering picture. It is a cozy sitting-room, papered with taste and
    furnished in harmony. Everything looks neat, from the snowy bed-spread to the pretty
    clock on the mantel, and the dainty bunch of pansies on the wall above. Open doors
    give glimpses of other rooms as well ordered as this, while intelligence and kindness
    beam in the dark faces of gentle mother and cheery bright-eyed daughters. When people
    ask us how we can bear to teach "niggers," they generally have in mind those
    tattered, lazy persons, who are most wont to show themselves on the street corners,
    and so make the deepest impression on the average white mind.</p>
    <p>But look at my third picture, and you will see both how we can like our work, and
    what is one of the things that make a difference between the second home I have
    described and the first. The large school-room is filled. More than one hundred and
    twenty-five students are arranged in classes, most of whom are standing in their
    places ready to pass to recitation rooms. One of their number is at the piano.
    Another stands at the desk to give the word of command. Now he strikes the bell and
    the pupils in long file pass out, marching with their heads up. Not a teacher is in
    sight. Everything is orderly and is running of itself, as it does every day. This is
    nothing wonderful, of course, though I know some white schools which could not be
    trusted to this degree to the control of monitors. But it is only a sign of the
    influences that here lead to self-reliance and self-control. Every year a new set of
    uncouth and undeveloped young people come shambling in, looking around with
    bewildered eyes. But they soon begin to straighten up and fall into step. Their vague
    ideas get settled, and their minds, slow at first, wake up. In a few years they will
    be made over new, not perfect, but vastly improved. They will be out teaching,
    spreading light from scores of new centres, and sending new pupils to "Old Le
    Moyne."</p>

    <h3>THE EVANGELIST AT WORK.</h3>
    <p>The last night of the three weeks' series of meetings at Marion was a memorable
    one. Every night the church, which was a large-sized building, was well filled with
    an attentive congregation, hungering and thirsting for the bread and water of life.
    After singing and prayer and hearing the testimonies from the young converts present,
    who told with unmistakable clearness how they had given their hearts to God, a few
    words were spoken, especially to them, showing what God requires of them now they
    have become Christians. Afterwards the gospel was preached to the unconverted and an
    invitation given for those who wished to become Christians to signify their desire. A
    number responded, including an old man supposed to be at least ninety years of age.
    The old man had long thought of being a Christian, but never could get to the point
    of decision until now. He looked back upon his long life of sin; he wept, he prayed,
    he arose and confessed that he had then and there taken Christ as his Saviour. Was
    not he a brand plucked from the burning?</p>
    <p>It was most encouraging to see a young lady bringing along to the pastor's house
    nearly every day some two or three of her school companions or friends, to be prayed
    for and spoken with about the way of salvation. The Christians worked faithfully
    visiting the houses of their friends to pray and speak with them and to bring them
    out to the meeting at night.</p>
    <p>At Mobile, although the first week it rained six days in succession, yet the
    people came out well and were repaid for their faithfulness. Every night for the past
    three weeks large numbers of all classes have been personally interested, and with
    the exception of one service, we have had cause to thank God for conversions. Fathers
    and mothers are rejoicing over sons and daughters brought to Christ. A large number
    of young people from the Sabbath-school as well as from the day-school have started
    on the new life. The teachers say that a marked change is observable and that the
    young converts seem to be trying their very best to live up to their profession.
    Forty-six were received into the church and will have the instruction that is so much
    needed by young converts.</p>
    <p>One of the teachers and myself, while visiting some of the converts, found five
    young women in one house rejoicing in the pardoning love of God. "Truly," said the
    old grandmother, "salvation has come to this house." We found that, some years ago,
    three mothers had died and left five orphan children, who were taken by the
    grandmother and who had now grown into womanhood. Two sisters first became Christians
    and the others soon followed. One said, "I used to be so fond of going to the
    theatre, but now I have no heart for that sort of thing; I mean to live a good
    Christian life and do all I can for my Saviour." They were all received into church,
    and joined as well the Young People's Society of <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page137" id="page137"></a>{137}</span> Christian Endeavor, which is a good
    thing for young people, as it trains them for future work, and to be active and
    useful in the service of Christ.</p>

    <h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>
    <h3>LETTER FROM REV. W.C. POND.</h3>
    <p>Our anniversary was an occasion of much interest. The attendance was large, and
    our brethren acquitted themselves well. The <i>Record-Union</i>, the principal daily
    of Sacramento, published both the addresses in full.</p>
    <p>We have good news from our evangelists. They are doing great good, if we can judge
    at all by what we see: and they are in training, I believe, for larger and better
    service in the years to come. I shall have much to write about this for the <i>next
    Missionary</i>, much more than I can crowd into the space allowed me.</p>
    <p>The new work at San Buenaventura opens finely. It is already one of our largest
    interior schools; and two or three, possibly <i>four</i>, of the Chinese have already
    been led to believe; so that before Low Quong returns he expects to organize an
    Association and get Christian work into systematic operation.</p>
    <p>I am greatly pleased also with the reports from Tucson. Yong Jin, who has done
    excellent evangelistic work at Santa Cruz, goes to Tucson next week. He is an earnest
    Christian, and though somewhat deficient in English is better educated in Chinese and
    is an excellent preacher.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="chinese2" id="chinese2"></a>
    <h3>FOUR MONTHS OF EVANGELISTIC WORK.</h3>
    <p>BY LOW QUONG.</p>
    <p>In January last I was asked to do some evangelistic work in the Northern part of
    this State. The first place I visited was Oroville. There we have a branch mission
    with a fine mission house, or, we might call it a Chinese church and school combined.
    The church has a membership of about fifteen. The evening scholars were usually about
    twenty or more. This school has a faithful teacher, and all together makes a fruitful
    mission. Although I was there only about a month&mdash;yet I enjoyed the work very
    much, and my acquaintance with the brethren there and their kindness to me I can
    never forget. I will now give you some little incidents of my work there. The town
    has about three hundred Chinese inhabitants, and most of our brethren and scholars
    live in the town, but there were also a good many outside of the town. These are
    mostly miners. But even these hard-working men, when they got through their day's
    work, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> came to
    town at night to attend our evening school; and on Sundays also, to hear the
    preaching of the gospel.</p>
    <p>At the end of the month, when Mr. Pond came to Oroville, we had the Lord's supper
    in our little Chinese church. It was held in the evening. One far-away brother was
    informed by letter, and he came over a long, rough road to attend the Lord's table.
    It was about eight o'clock when he reached the church. We asked him what time he
    started to walk; he said at one o'clock in the afternoon. He had walked fully seven
    hours just for the Lord's supper, and early in the morning he had to walk back again
    to his place, while we took the train for Marysville. During my stay at Oroville,
    four members were added to the Association and one was baptized and received to the
    church. We would have had two, but one had gone to work in a place sixty miles from
    town. He had waited for Mr. Pond to come up for nearly a whole month, so he could be
    baptized, and he had gone only a week when Mr. Pond came. Lately I have received a
    letter from him, that he has returned to Oroville.</p>
    <p>The Chinese inhabitants at Oroville are very kind to the Christian Chinese. They
    never trouble them and always send their boys to the evening school. I heard not long
    ago from their teacher, that the whole mission house has been renovated and a new
    floor put down at the expense of the brethren and scholars.</p>

    <h3>CHIN GAING IN CHINA.</h3>
    <p>[EXTRACT FROM AN ADDRESS IN ALAMEDA, CAL., BY CHIN GAING.]</p>
    <p>It is over eleven years since I left my home in China. Near the end of 1882 I
    began to attend the mission school in San Francisco. After being there about two
    years I joined the Christian Association, and six months from then I was baptized and
    joined Bethany Church.</p>
    <p>Two years ago I returned to China. My friends there knew that I had changed my
    religion, and so, when I went back they asked me many questions.</p>
    <p>My relatives wanted to know about the people in this country, what religion they
    had and what gods they worshiped. And whether the Chinese who went there believed the
    same as the American people.</p>
    <p>I told them we believed in one God. They said, "Which one?"</p>
    <p>I answered, the one that created the heaven and the earth, and all things in the
    world and the sea. The God who has all power and whom we ought to worship.</p>
    <p>My mother then came up and said: "Do not talk such things; we are Chinese and must
    keep our customs."</p>
    <p>I said I could not keep those which were against God. So they said: "If you have
    anything good, then keep it."</p>
    <p>While in China I could not help seeing how much the people spent in <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>{139}</span> foolishness. They
    have so many idol processions, which cost a great deal of money. The people gladly
    give to keep up their worship, as they are in darkness and know not the name of
    Jesus, which is the only name under heaven given among men whereby we must be
    saved.</p>

    <p>"Twenty-three unanswered letters look down upon me. Eighteen came to-day." Such is
    the burdened sigh of one of our earnest, self-denying missionaries, who is upon the
    mission field that she may relieve the suffering, teach the ignorant and save souls,
    and for whom the days are all too short for these duties alone.</p>
    <p>Have our readers ever felt the burden of unanswered letters? Pastors,
    Sunday-school teachers, housekeepers&mdash;busy people that you are&mdash;have you
    ever felt the twinge of unrest, almost discouragement, because some friendly letter,
    which you enjoyed receiving, lay unanswered waiting a spare hour? And have you ever
    had to "brace up" to what, in a life of leisure might be a pastime, but in a life so
    full of care and responsibility becomes a task? Then you will surely be ready
    unselfishly to</p>
    <a name="bureau2" id="bureau2"></a>
    <h3>SPARE OUR TEACHERS.</h3>
    <p>How can it be done? Not by withholding your letters from them. If any missionaries
    anywhere need words of appreciation and good cheer they are those who year after year
    sacrifice social life and religious privileges to mingle with the ignorant,
    uncultured&mdash;yes, and impure&mdash;that they may lift them up into the healthful
    ways of righteousness. Write to them, encourage <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page140" id="page140"></a>{140}</span> them, but do not ask for a special
    letter for your next missionary meeting. Tell them <i>not to write</i>, that you have
    heard or can hear from them every month through their letters sent to the officers at
    New York and that you learn of the work through the A.M.A. magazine. Thank them for
    making this monthly missionary letter so full and interesting.</p>
    <p>"But that monthly letter is a copied letter," some one answers, "and we wish our
    teacher to write to us, <i>to us alone, and in her own hand</i>." Yes, it is a copied
    letter in order that it may be sent to others who are interested in, and helping, the
    same work, and that the missionaries' time may be given to the work about them
    instead of being spent so largely in writing. But it is a fresh letter. It has the
    latest monthly news and was written for you, and if not in the same hand is as truly
    yours as a typewritten letter, which is the sort most of us receive and give in the
    high-work pressure of now-a-days.</p>
    <p>We provide <i>The American Missionary</i>, furnish our printed leaflets freely,
    and will send the monthly missionary letters to all who desire to hear thus from
    their contributions&mdash;as we hope all do&mdash;thus giving the very best
    information that the field affords; but we most earnestly hope the missionaries may
    be allowed their time for their missionary duties pressing upon them. <i>The
    Missionary</i> is the word from your missionary. Read it, and if you do not like it,
    write us, and we will try again next month.</p>

    <p>Some manufacturers of mixed paints direct NOT to rub out the paint, but to FLOW it

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
